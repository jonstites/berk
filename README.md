# berk

`berk` is a git-like version control system.

## When should I use `berk`?

You should use `git` if you want something that is better-supported, has more features, is more widely used, and can interact with `git` tools (like GitHub or GitLab).

You should use `berk` if you really like the idea of VCS commands being atomic and well-defined even under system failure (like a power outage). `berk` uses Sqlite under the hood. It is possible that `berk` scales better under lots of little files.
